    <p>
      Itâ€™s a web development system that helps the customer to have a better experience than any traditional barbers.
      It lets the client choose his barber, the type of service he wants,
      how long is he going to wait and how much is he going to pay.
      Moreover,
      the system is integrated with third-party companies so that the customer can give feedback about his experience.
      Not only the customer who is going to gain from this system but also the owner too by providing the oversee of barbers,
      the ques, reports, and the feedback reviews.
